inotifyx Release Notes
======================

.. contents::


inotifyx 0.2.2 2014-08-25
=========================

 * Added release file to MANIFEST.in.  This fixes incorrect version number
   reporting for release tarballs.
   (Forest Bond)


inotifyx 0.2.1 2014-08-25
=========================

 * Some reference counting bugs in get_events were fixed.  This prevents leaking
   memory while processing events.
   (Henry Stern)

 * A bug with memory allocation failure handling in get_events was fixed.  This
   prevents a segmentation fault under low memory conditions.
   (Forest Bond)

 * inotify events with zero-length name fields are now properly handled.
   Previously, segmentation faults and other errors would have occurred if such
   events were received.
   (Forest Bond)

 * A distutils manifest is now provided.  Source code tarballs can now be
   generated via setup.py, and this mechanism will be used to generate official
   release tarballs.
   (Forest Bond)

 * The "download_url" distutils option is no longer specified.  Release tarballs
   will be available directly from PyPI.  This is now required by pip.
   (Forest Bond)


inotifyx 0.2.0 2011-07-09
=========================

 * The distutils option "download_url" is now specified.  This should fix
   problems using pip, zc.buildout, and other tools that rely on PyPI for
   package downloads to install inotifyx.  Thanks to Dariusz Suchojad for
   the report.
   (Forest Bond)

 * inotifyx is now distributed as a Python package instead of a few bare
   modules.  The "_inotifyx" C extension is now shipped as "inotifyx.binding".
   This change should be backwards compatible with respect to imports since
   the C extension did not directly implement public interfaces.
   (Forest Bond)

 * A __version__ attribute is now provided.  This specifies the version
   of the inotifyx library.  Thanks to Jérôme Laheurte for the suggestion.
   (Forest Bond)


inotifyx 0.1.2 2011-03-31
=========================

 * Threads are now allowed during I/O operations.  Thanks to Jean-Baptiste
   Denis for the report and patch.
   (Forest Bond)


inotifyx 0.1.1 2009-10-18
=========================

 * Fix integer truncation of timeout argument in get_events.  Thanks to Eric
   Firing for the report and patch.
   (Forest Bond)


inotifyx 0.1.0 2009-04-26
=========================

 * Initial release.
   (Forest Bond)
