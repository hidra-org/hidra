The argument '--beamline' is mandatory for all commands. It can be one of the
following:
"p01", "p02.1", "p02.2", "p03", "p04", "p05", "p06", "p07", "p08", "p09",
"p10", "p11"

The script only is allowed to be executed from beamline PCs corresponding to
the specified beamline.

# Start:
./hidra_control_client.py --beamline <beamline> --det <detector ip or dns name> --start

For starting hidra the detector IP or DNS name is mandatory and the API version
of the filewriter may be set (default is 1.5.0). The detector specified has to be
registered for the beamline.
By default all data is written into current/raw in the beamline file system.
To choose a different path execute the following.

# Start with alternativ path:
./hidra_control_client.py --beamline <beamline> --det <detector ip or dns name> --target current/scratch_bl --start

Permitted are "current/raw", "current/scratch_bl", "commissioning/raw",
"commissioning/scratch_bl" and "local".
The directory structure is inherited as created on the detector.

# Stop:
./hidra_control_client.py --beamline <beamline> --stop

# Check status:
./hidra_control_client.py --beamline <beamline> --status
